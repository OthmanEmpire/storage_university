                <h2>A Guide To An Othman AliKhan</h2>

                <p>Despite my name being Othman, it is pronounced numerous ways depending on the language. Therefore, to simplify matters, let me introduce myself as "Oz Alikhan". I came to the University of Leeds as a Saudi Arabian student however my true origins are from Pakistan.

The reason I choose the University of Leeds is due to its location in Leeds; quiet and peaceful. To be precise, I was previously studying a BEng degree in London however due to my strong dislike of the subject and location (I found it too dynamic and lively), I eventually shifted to Leeds.</p>

                <p>As for the reason why I choose Computer Science & Mathematics, it was because I was introduced to programming when I was studying in London and I found that on par with Mathematics in terms of enjoyment, creativity and critical thinking.</p>                 

                <p>As for my hobbies & interests, I have spent several years trying to explore different things to do. Some of the hobbies I have picked up on the way are:</p>

                <ul>
                        <li>Martial Arts (Taekwondo & perhaps picking up Ju-Jitsu)</li>                        
                        <li>Drawing (e.g. doors, a mechanical arm, etc)</li>
                        <li>Chess</li>
                        <li>Gaming (Dota 2, SC2, WoW, etc)</li>
                        <li>Juggling</li>
                        <li>Programming in C (Mini AI project, etc)</li>
                        <li>Networking (Optimizing my home network back at Saudi by fiddling around)</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h2>About Our Android Application</h2>
                
                <p>Together, we created a simple android app. The app functions via several ways: by pressing a button, by shaking & by voice recognition. Afterwards, we disabandoned the group and reconstructed our own versions of the app.<br>The app that I created is called the "Humanity App". The main purpose of this app is to question your humanity. Below are some images to demonstrate the act:</p><br>
