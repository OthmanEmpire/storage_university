Implement a program that simulates the encoding, transmission, and decoding of
strings as sequences of bits. At the top level, the program should consist of three functions which take each character and convert it to and from an 8-bit binary representation.

type Bit = Int
encode :: String -> [Bit]
channel :: [Bit] -> [Bit]
decode :: [Bit] -> String
