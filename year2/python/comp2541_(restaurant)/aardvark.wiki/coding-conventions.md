To standardize the code to some degree, we will adopt our own coding convention (or at least attempt to). The link to the document is: **[Coding Conventions](assets/docs/project_conventions.pdf)**.
<br><br>

Apart from the coding conventions, so that everyone could have access to the same tools if need be, the items below include the tool names along with their links. **Be warned**, the links are the  **DEFAULT** download page so make sure you are downloading the correct version as stated below.
