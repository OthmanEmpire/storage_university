# Team Aardvark
<br>
This section contains some information about the testing throughout the project.
<br><br>

The testing involved in the project ranged from unittesting, functional testing and some manual testing (GUI). All tests are located in the main repository under a folder named '_tests_'. 
<br><br>

The unittests as expected tested invidual methods and functions in isolation, providing mock objects using the python unittest library. On the other hand, the functional tests tested multiple units interacting together (essentially the system or parts of it).
<br><br>

There are a total of **45 tests** in the project that all pass.

As for the semi-manual testing of the GUI, **the details of things to check is included in a docstring within the test file code**. It's just a list that contains things to check really.
